# TikZiT for VS Code

[TikZiT](https://tikzit.github.io) is a simple GUI editor for graphs and string diagrams. Its native file format is a subset of PGF/TikZ, which means TikZiT files can be included directly in papers typeset using LaTeX. This is a VS Code extension that aims to provide a very similar UI to TikZiT directly inside of the editor.

This is still experimental, with many features, bugfixes, and documentation still to come. However, the basic functionality is there. It will get its own docs at some point, but for now have a look at the [Quickstart](https://tikzit.github.io/#quickstart) for TikZiT 2 to get an overview of how things work.
