# TikZiT - VSCode Extension

This extension is a port of the [TikZiT](https://github.com/yasuhito/tikzit) editor, which aims to provide a similar editing experience for `.tikz` files directly in Visual Studio Code. Currently it is missing many features, but watch this space!

npm install
npm run compile
```

### Testing the Extension

1. Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window
2. Open a `.tikz` file to test the custom editor

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.102.0 or higher
